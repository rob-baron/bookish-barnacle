# bookish-barnacle
This is an example interface that I am working on with my neighbor as a way of making what he is doing in excel more manageable (I hope).

# development environment
- vscode  ( https://code.visualstudio.com/download)https://code.visualstudio.com/download )
- docker  ( https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ )
- git     ( https://git-scm.com/downloads )
## this is a possiblity
- gitbutler ( git clone https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler.git )

# 2 containers:
- Postgres container  ( for the database )
- Python3 container   ( for an API layer )
- UI - defering decision until later.

# How to start the containers
```
   % docker build -f Dockerfile.py3 -t py3 py3
   % docker compose up
```

# How to open a broser to view this project
1) Open in incognito window for your browser. 
2) from the docker compose up command:

# How to log into the containers (after the docker compose up).
For example, you can log in to the web container by first fined the containers that are runing using 'docker ps'
```
    % docker ps   
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES
    fb67a338fde9   web:latest             "python manage.py ru…"   5 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp   bookish-barnacle-web-1
    8ebfccfd00d8   postgres:13.4-alpine   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   5 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   bookish-barnacle-db-1
```
log into the running container from the container name:
```
    % docker exec -it bookish-barnacle-web-1 bash 
```
Or from the container id:
```
    % docker exec -it fb67a338fde9 bash 
```
You can log in to the database continer in the same manner.

#Modifying the code:
##1 clone the repository to your local directory
```
git clone https://github.com/rob-baron/bookish-barnacle.git
```
##2 open the bookish-barnicle directory using vscode
Start up vscode, and open the cloned directory

The directory structure is as follows:
```
- bookish-barnicle
    .gitignore
    Dockerfile.web
    LICENSE
    README.md
    docker-compose.yaml
    data/
        ....                  (data directory of database)
    database/
        init.sql
    app/                      (django files (python) )
        AssemblyStatus/        
            __init__.py
            asgi.py
            settings.py
            urls.py
            wsgi.py
        manage.py
```
The docker-compose file mounts the data directory in to the postgres
continer, and mounts the app directory into the app directory of the
web container.  This makes editing the code outside of the container
possible, as well as using git outside of the container to manage
how the files of the project.

For certain operations, like running manage.py, you will need to log
into the web/python container to run manage.py from the commandline.
